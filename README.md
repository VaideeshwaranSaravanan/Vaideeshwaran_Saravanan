# 👋 Hi, I'm Vaideeshwaran Saravanan

🔐 AI + Cybersecurity | MSc in Computer Science, University of Guelph  
🧠 Researcher in Post-Quantum Cryptography, Machine Learning, and Secure Systems

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a recent MSc Computer Science graduate from the University of Guelph with a strong focus on **AI for Security**, **RSA cryptanalysis**, and **post-quantum cryptography**. My thesis explored the use of Transformer models and quantized neural networks for recovering plaintext from RSA ciphertexts — contributing to the intersection of deep learning and cryptanalysis.

I’ve also served as a Teaching Assistant across 6 university-level courses, mentored 300+ students, and contributed to real-world software systems like a live theatre ticketing platform and an IoT-based rescue robot.

I’m currently building my public portfolio, enhancing my coding fluency through daily practice, and pursuing cybersecurity certifications.

### 💡 Fun Fact:
When I’m not exploring cryptography or training models, I’m probably solving DSA problems, debugging a side project, or handling personal problems. 😄
